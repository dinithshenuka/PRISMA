# PRISMA

A CLI tool for running a [PRISMA](https://www.prisma-statement.org/) systematic literature review (SLR) — import papers from multiple academic databases, deduplicate, screen by title/abstract, and track full-text retrieval, all from the terminal with zero external dependencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external packages — pure stdlib only

---

## Usage

```bash
# Option 1: make shortcut
make dev

# Option 2: run directly
python3 src/prisma_cli.py
```

The app is fully menu-driven — no arguments needed.

---

## Workflow

1. **Create a project** — each SLR gets its own project with isolated database records.
2. **Import papers** — drop exported `.csv` or `.ris` files into `data/imports/<project_name>/`. The tool auto-detects the source database and parses accordingly.
3. **Deduplicate** — scan for exact DOI matches and near-identical titles across all imports. Review each duplicate group and choose which copy to keep.
4. **Screen by title/abstract** — go through papers one-by-one and mark each as `include`, `exclude`, or `skip`. Open the DOI in your browser mid-session.
5. **View stats** — see a live breakdown of imported, included, excluded, and skipped counts per database, with drill-down paper lists.
6. **Full-text retrieval** — open any paper's DOI directly from the project menu to track down PDFs.


## Supported Import Formats

| Database            | Format |
|---------------------|--------|
| IEEE Xplore         | `.csv` |
| Scopus              | `.csv` |
| Web of Science      | `.ris` |
| ACM Digital Library | `.ris` |
| Springer            | `.csv` |
| PubMed              | `.ris` |

## Paper Stages

Each paper moves through these stages as you work:

| Stage            | Meaning                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `unscreened`     | Not yet reviewed                             |
| `title_included` | Passed title/abstract screening              |
| `title_excluded` | Rejected at title/abstract stage             |
| `duplicate`      | Flagged as a duplicate and removed from flow |

## Deduplication

The dedup scanner runs two passes automatically:

1. **Exact DOI match** — papers sharing the same DOI (common when the same paper is exported from multiple databases).
2. **Fuzzy title match** — papers whose normalised titles score ≥ 0.92 similarity via `difflib.SequenceMatcher` (catches the same paper published in multiple venues with identical/near-identical titles).

For each group found, you choose which copy to keep — the rest are marked `duplicate` and excluded from screening.
